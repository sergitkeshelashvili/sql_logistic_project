# SQL Logistics Project 📦

📖 Overview
The SQL Logistics Project is a comprehensive database solution designed to manage and analyze logistics operations. It implements a star schema to efficiently store and query data related to customers, products, vehicles, drivers, warehouses, routes, suppliers, orders, employees, and shipments. The project includes SQL scripts for database initialization, constraints, indexing, and data analysis, along with an Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD) for visualization.

🗂️ Project Structure
The repository contains the following files:

📄 init_database.sql: Creates the database, tables, and populates them with random data for testing.
🔒 slq_constraints.sql: Defines constraints to ensure data integrity.
⚡ slq_indexes_and_performance_optimization.sql: Implements indexes to optimize query performance.
📊 sql_logistic_data_analysis.sql: Contains analytical queries for insights into logistics operations (e.g., shipment performance, sales trends, route profitability).
🖼️ star_schema_ERD.png: Visual representation of the star schema database structure.


🚀 Features

Star Schema Design: Organizes data into dimension and fact tables for efficient querying.
Data Integrity: Enforces constraints to maintain consistency across tables.
Performance Optimization: Uses indexes to improve query execution speed.
Comprehensive Analysis: Includes queries for customer segmentation, shipment performance, route profitability, and seasonal demand forecasting.
Scalable Data: Populates tables with randomized data for testing and analysis.

📈 Example Queries

Count customers and suppliers by city/region.
Analyze vehicle performance and maintenance metrics.
Evaluate driver performance based on successful shipments.
Forecast seasonal demand and calculate month-over-month sales changes.
Optimize routes by analyzing cost per kilometer and profitability.


📚 Technologies Used

PostgreSQL: For database creation and management.
SQL: For schema design, data population, and analysis.
